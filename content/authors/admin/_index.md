I am a Ph.D. student at School of Computer Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU) since 2020. I received my master degree in Control Engineering and bachelor degree in Electronic Information Engineering from Civil Aviation University of China. Since 2017, I have been working as an intern at the Center for Applied Mathematics (CAM) of Tianjin University for two years. During this time, I developed a strong interest in Natural Language Processing (NLP), which led me to decide to pursue my Ph.D. 

My research areas currently include **Pretrained Models Tuning**, **Attribution**, **Text-based Personality Detection**, etc.
