I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Technology at School of Computer Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University. I received my M.E. degree in Control Engineering and B.E. degree in Electronic Information Engineering from Civil Aviation University of China. My research primarily focuses on Natural Language Processing. I am delighted to share that I have been accepted into the 2023 Tencent Rhino-Bird Research Elite Training Program at Tencent AI Lab. During this program, I will be conducting research on trustworthy generative AI. 

My research areas currently include **Alignment of LLMs**, **Attribution Analysis**, **Text-based Personality Detection**, etc.
