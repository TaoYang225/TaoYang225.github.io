I am a PhD student at School of Computer Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU) since 2020, surpervised by Prof. [XiaoJun Quan](https://sites.google.com/site/xiaojunquan/homepage). I received my master degree in Control Engineering and bachelor degree in Electronic Information Engineering from Civil Aviation University of China. During my postgraduate study, I worked as a research intern at Center for Applied Mathematics (CAM)，Tianjin University for two years. I had strong interests in natural language processing (NLP) during this period, which made me decide to continue for a doctorate. My research areas currently include **Pretrained Models Tuning**, **Attribution**, **Text-based Personality Detection**, etc.
