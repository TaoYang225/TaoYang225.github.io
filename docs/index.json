However, the potential of LLMs in personality detection, which involves identifying an individual personality from their written texts, remains largely unexplored. Drawing inspiration from Psychological Questionnaires, which are carefully designed by psychologists to evaluate individual personality traits through a series of targeted items, we argue that these items can be regarded as a collection of well-structured chain-of-thought (CoT) processes. By incorporating these processes, LLMs can enhance their capabilities to make more reasonable inferences on personality from textual input. In light of this, we propose a novel personality detection method, called PsyCoT, which mimics the way individuals complete psychological questionnaires in a multi-turn dialogue manner. In particular, we employ a LLM as an AI assistant with a specialization in text analysis. We prompt the assistant to rate individual items at each turn and leverage the historical rating results to derive a conclusive personality preference. Our experiments demonstrate that PsyCoT significantly improves the performance and robustness of GPT-3.5 in personality detection, achieving an average F1 score improvement of 4.23/10.63 points on two benchmark datasets compared to the standard prompting method.","tags":[],"title":"PsyCoT: Psychological Questionnaire as Powerful Chain-of-Thought for Personality Detection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tianyuan Shi","Liangzhi Li","Zijian Lin","Tao Yang","Xiaojun Quan","Qifan Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1698019200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1698019200,"objectID":"2680df6337130b4350d4e96d88df26a2","permalink":"https://taoyang225.github.io/publication/dual-feedback-knowledge-retrieval-for-task-oriented-dialogue-systems/","publishdate":"2023-10-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dual-feedback-knowledge-retrieval-for-task-oriented-dialogue-systems/","section":"publication","summary":"Efficient knowledge retrieval plays a pivotal role in ensuring the success of end-to-end task-oriented dialogue systems by facilitating the selection of relevant information necessary to fulfill user requests. However, current approaches generally integrate knowledge retrieval and response generation, which poses scalability challenges when dealing with extensive knowledge bases. Taking inspiration from open-domain question answering, we propose a retriever-generator architecture that harnesses a retriever to retrieve pertinent knowledge and a generator to generate system responses.~Due to the lack of retriever training labels, we propose relying on feedback from the generator as pseudo-labels to train the retriever. To achieve this, we introduce a dual-feedback mechanism that generates both positive and negative feedback based on the output of the generator.

Built upon representative domain use cases, Explore-Instruct explores a multitude of variations or possibilities by implementing a search algorithm to obtain diversified and domain-focused instruction-tuning data.

However, earlier works mainly focus on the construction of positive examples, while in-batch samples are often simply treated as negative examples.

To address these issues, we propose ClusterNS (Clustering-aware Negative Sampling), a novel method that incorporates cluster information into contrastive learning for unsupervised sentence representation learning. We apply a modified K-means clustering algorithm to supply hard negatives and recognize in-batch false negatives during training, aiming to solve the two issues in one unified framework.

One of the challenges for this task is to piece together information in different posts into an overall profile for each user. While many existing approaches either simply assemble the posts into a document that can be encoded sequentially or into a hierarchical structure, they introduce unnecessary orders for the posts which may mislead the models. In this paper, we propose a novel model named dynamic deep graph convolutional network (D-DGCN) to overcome the above limitation by fusing the posts of a user disorderly into a user representation. We also design a learn-to-connect approach that adopts a dynamic multi-hop structure instead of a deterministic structure, and combine it with the DGCN module to automatically learn the connections between posts. The modules of post encoder, learn-to-connect, and DGCN are jointly trained in an end-to-end manner.

While dropout proves to be an effective antidote by randomly dropping a proportion of units, existing research has not examined its effect on the self-attention mechanism. In this paper, we investigate this problem through self-attention attribution and find that dropping attention positions with low attribution scores can accelerate training and increase the risk of overfitting. Motivated by this observation, we propose Attribution-Driven Dropout (AD-DROP), which randomly discards some high-attribution positions to encourage the model to make predictions by relying more on low-attribution positions to reduce overfitting. We also develop a cross-tuning strategy to alternate fine-tuning and AD-DROP to avoid dropping high-attribution positions excessively. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks show that AD-DROP yields consistent improvements over baselines. Analysis further confirms that AD-DROP serves as a strategic regularizer to prevent overfitting during fine-tuning.","tags":[],"title":"AD-DROP: Attribution-Driven Dropout for Robust Language Model Fine-Tuning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Feifan Yang","Tao Yang","Xiaojun Quan","Qinliang Su"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1635724800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635724800,"objectID":"f187f43d9049e564199a9f2d49ff1760","permalink":"https://taoyang225.github.io/publication/2021.findings-emnlp.98/","publishdate":"2021-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021.findings-emnlp.98/","section":"publication","summary":"Existing text-based personality detection research mostly relies on data-driven approaches to implicitly capture personality cues in online posts, lacking the guidance of psychological knowledge.

To this end, we propose a new model named Psychological Questionnaire enhanced Network (PQ-Net) to guide personality detection by tracking critical information in texts with a questionnaire. Specifically, PQ-Net contains two streams: a context stream to encode each piece of text into a contextual text representation, and a questionnaire stream to capture relevant information in the contextual text representation to generate potential answer representations for a questionnaire. The potential answer representations are used to enhance the contextual text representation and to benefit personality prediction.

The graph network injects structural psycholinguistic knowledge in LIWC, a computerized instrument for psycholinguistic analysis, by constructing a heterogeneous tripartite graph. The initializer is employed to provide initial embeddings for the graph nodes. To reduce the computational cost in graph learning, we further propose a novel flow graph attention network (GAT) that only transmits messages between neighboring parties in the tripartite graph. Benefiting from the tripartite graph, TrigNet can aggregate post information from a psychological perspective, which is a novel way of exploiting domain knowledge. Extensive experiments on two datasets show that TrigNet outperforms the existing state-of-art model by 3.47 and 2.10 points in average F1.

Numerous sentiment classification techniques, including conventional and deep-learning-based methods, have been proposed in the literature. In most existing methods, a high-quality training set is assumed to be given. Nevertheless, constructing a high-quality training set that consists of highly accurate labels is challenging in real applications. This difficulty stems from the fact that text samples usually contain complex sentiment representations, and their annotation is subjective. We address this challenge in this study by leveraging a new labeling strategy and utilizing a two-level long short-term memory network to construct a sentiment classifier. Lexical cues are useful for sentiment analysis, and they have been utilized in conventional studies. For example, polar and negation words play important roles in sentiment analysis. A new encoding strategy, that is, ρ-hot encoding, is proposed to alleviate the drawbacks of one-hot encoding and, thus, effectively incorporate useful lexical cues. Moreover, the sentimental polarity of a word may change in different sentences due to label noise or context. A flipping model is proposed to model the polar flipping of words in a sentence. We compile three Chinese datasets on the basis of our label strategy and proposed methodology. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on both benchmark English data and our compiled Chinese data.","tags":[],"title":"Two-Level LSTM for Sentiment Analysis With Lexicon Embedding and Polar Flipping","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tao Yang","Rujing Yao","Qing Yin","Qiang Tian","Ou Wu"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1595635200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1595635200,"objectID":"92afc83104c1507cf98b18aa0a11ae5e","permalink":"https://taoyang225.github.io/publication/mitigating-sentimental-bias-via-a-polar-attention-mechanism/","publishdate":"2020-07-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mitigating-sentimental-bias-via-a-polar-attention-mechanism/","section":"publication","summary":"Fairness in machine learning has received increasing attention in recent years.

Sentimental bias occurs on words (or phrases) when they are distributed distinctly in positive and negative corpora. It results in that an excessively proportion of words carry negative/positive sentiment in learned models. This study proposed a new attention mechanism, called polar attention, to mitigate sentimental biases. It consists of two modules, namely polar flipping and distance measurement. The first module explicitly models word sentimental polarity and can prevent that neutral words flip positively or negatively. The second module is used to attend negative/positive words.

First, a novel sub-network is introduced to represent a target in a sentence in ABSA by considering the whole context. Second, lexicon embedding is applied to incorporate additional lexical cues.
